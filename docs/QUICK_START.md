# ⚡ QUICK START - Run Your First AI Model in 3 Steps!

**Hi Bhavika Baddur!** Ready to analyze 20,000 customer reviews with AI? Let's go! 🚀

---

## 🎯 What You'll Do (Total Time: 5 minutes)

You'll train an AI model that reads customer reviews and tells you if they're:
- 😊 **POSITIVE** (happy customers)
- 😐 **NEUTRAL** (okay customers)
- 😞 **NEGATIVE** (unhappy customers)

---

## 📋 The 3 Steps

### Step 1️⃣: Install Libraries (ONE TIME ONLY)

Open PowerShell in your project folder:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

**Wait 30 seconds.** Done? ✅

---

### Step 2️⃣: Run the Magic Script

Type this:

```bash
python scripts/04_simple_sentiment_analysis.py
```

**Press Enter and watch!** ⏳ (Takes 2-3 minutes)

---

### Step 3️⃣: See Your Results! 🎉

You'll see something like this in your terminal:

```
🎯 MODEL ACCURACY: 78.45%
   This means the model correctly identified sentiment in 78.5% of reviews!

✅ MODEL SUMMARY:
   • Trained on: 16,000 reviews
   • Tested on: 4,000 reviews
   • Accuracy: 78.45%
   • Vocabulary: 5000 words
```

**Also created:**
- 📊 `reports/images/confusion_matrix.png` (visual chart)
- 🤖 `models/sentiment_model.pkl` (your trained AI!)

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

After running, you should have:

- [x] Script completed without errors
- [x] Saw accuracy score (hopefully 75%+!)
- [x] Created confusion matrix image
- [x] Saved AI model files
- [x] Saw predictions for sample reviews

**All checked?** 🎊 **Congratulations! You just built your first AI model!**

## 🤔 What If Something Goes Wrong?

### Error: "No module named 'sklearn'"
**Fix:** Run `pip install scikit-learn` first

### Error: "File not found"
**Fix:** Make sure you're in the project folder:
```bash
cd c:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\ecommerce-sentiment-project
```

### Script is taking forever (>10 minutes)
**Fix:** Be patient! First run takes time. Make tea ☕
